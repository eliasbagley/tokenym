<meta name="description" content="Tokenym lets anyone enter their preferred password in order to receive a one-time token, then use it as a single-use password wherever it is accepted. Tokenym also features an ultra-secure grid method for two-factor authentication. Tokenym allows anyone to receive a token from a participating site, to redeem on demand to see if the site has the same unique ID as before (to detect fake sites).">

<br> To verify a token and redeem it for an ID, use JSON to connect to tokenym.appspot.com/IDService?token=xyz, where xyz is the token.
<br> A JSON response will be returned, where the attribute "id" contains the id that is returned. If the empty string is returned, then the token is not valid.
