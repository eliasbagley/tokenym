<meta name="Tokenym lets anyone enter their preferred password in order to receive a one-time token, then use it as a single-use password wherever it is accepted. Tokenym also features an ultra-secure grid method for two-factor authentication. Tokenym allows anyone to receive a token from a participating site, to redeem on demand to see if the site has the same unique ID as before (to detect fake sites).">

<center><h1>User FAQ</h1></center>


<p>1. Tokenym is a single-use password function that allows a user to enter a password to get a token.

<p>2. The user copies the token they receive from their password and uses it for a single-use password wherever it is accepted, such as a website or a locked door.

<p>3. A service provider that accepts the token will send the token back to Tokenym for a unique identifier to match in their database.

<p>4. The user's password is not stored by Tokenym, nor by any service provider that accepts the token. The password is only known by the user.

<p>5. Tokenym does not store any email address, IP address, user names, or any other personal information, by design.

<p>6. For high level security, Tokenym features a grid function to manually encrypt a password, in order to avoid keystroke loggers and "man-in-the-browser" attacks.

<p>7. A grid token requires the previous last token, which is logged in the user's email. A private email to ledger tokens, and a unique password for grid tokens, is safest.

<p>8. Always make a paper copy of the emailed key grid, then put it in a wallet, then delete the email version. If lost, simply request a new one. It is useless by itself.

<p>9. For high level security, choose the grid feature, then enter email address and the previous last token received for an on-screen randomized grid.

<p>10. Using the paper grid key, a user enters the characters which have the exact same position as their on-screen password. This makes it uniquely different each time.

<p>11. Any number of passwords can be made from one grid, and basic tokens and grid tokens are not interchangeable at the service provider using the same password.

<p>12. There is an add-on function that allows the user to append shared information with a service provider, such as an order number, to their password when getting a token.

<p>13. When a user appends anything to a password (example: *******#543945) to get a token, the service provider must append the exact same thing for a match to occur.

<p>14. A user can request a token from a service provider to manually check to see if the unique identifier matches one previously received, in order to detect a fake website.
